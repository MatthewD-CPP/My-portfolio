I’m currently completing my `B.S. in Marketing Management` at **Cal Poly Pomona**, where I’ve developed skills in digital marketing, advertising analytics, and campaign strategy. I’m graduating this semester and actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world business settings.

Throughout my coursework and hands-on projects, I've worked with tools like Google Analytics, Meta Ads Manager, R, and Excel to analyze customer data, optimize ad campaigns, and measure ROI across platforms.
