Each project showcases how I combine creativity with performance metrics to drive measurable marketing outcomes.\n\n## Meta Ads Campaign Optimization\n\nI led the optimization of paid advertising campaigns using Meta Ads Manager.

I created original content for multiple platforms, tailored messaging to customer personas, and monitored campaign performance to guide content adjustments.\n\n**Skills Demonstrated:**\n- **Content Creation:** Wrote platform-specific captions and designed creative assets.\n- **Persona-Based Messaging:** Crafted posts aligned with targeted audience profiles.\n- **Engagement Tracking:** Analyzed likes, CTR, and conversions across platforms.\n- **Campaign Planning:** Scheduled and optimized posts based on engagement patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Product Promotion Campaign – Persona Activation Strategy\n\nI designed and launched a targeted Messenger ad campaign aimed at driving direct engagement with a high-intent customer persona. The campaign featured short-form copy tailored to mobile consumption and encouraged conversation-based conversion through Meta’s Messenger platform.\n\n**Skills Demonstrated:**\n- **Persona Activation:** Segmented and targeted audiences based on behavioral intent and demographics.\n- **Direct Response Strategy:** Structured campaign around urgency and engagement-focused CTAs.\n- **Ad Copywriting:** Created concise, action-driven messages optimized for Messenger format.\n- **Conversion Optimization:** Monitored CTR and CPC to iteratively improve campaign performance.\n\n---\n\n## SEO & Brand Positioning Report\n\nI conducted a comparative SEO analysis of two competitive brands, reviewing keyword strategy, metadata, and content hierarchy. The findings informed a revised brand positioning strategy and website optimization recommendations.\n\n**Skills Demonstrated:**\n- **SEO Benchmarking:** Evaluated keyword usage and on-page structure.\n- **Strategic Positioning:** Recommended clearer, differentiated messaging.\n- **Technical Audit:** Reviewed site architecture, tags, and meta content.\n- **Report Communication:** Delivered insights in a clear, visual format.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# Read the file\ndf <- read_excel(\"data/Gym Reapers Spreadsheet.xlsx\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nNew names:\n• `` -> `...2`\n• `` -> `...3`\n• `` -> `...4`\n• `` -> `...5`\n• `` -> `...6`\n• `` -> `...7`\n• `` -> `...8`\n• `` -> `...9`\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Show a preview\ndf %>%\n  head(10) %>%\n  kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Instagram (Gym Reapers). |...2                |...3                                        |...4                                                                                            |...5                              |...6                                           |...7                                                                                            |...8               |...9                  |\n|:------------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------|:---------------------|\n|NA                       |NA                  |NA                                          |NA                                                                                              |NA                                |NA                                             |NA                                                                                              |NA                 |NA                    |\n|Account & Branding       |NA                  |NA                                          |NA                                                                                              |NA                                |NA                                             |NA                                                                                              |NA                 |NA                    |\n|NA                       |User Name (handle)  |Image                                       |URL                                                                                             |Account Descriptor (Bio)          |URL in Bio (All links work?
